                <p>About me... </p>
                <p>With over a decade of experience in education, I specialize in math, computer science, physical sciences, and standardized test preparation. I've taught high school math in public schools, GED courses for adult learners, and online software engineering—always with a focus on meeting students where they are. What I love most about teaching is helping students break through self-doubt and realize they can succeed, even in subjects they once found intimidating. My hands-on approach is adaptable to all learning styles, and I’m passionate about making complex topics feel approachable and achievable. I’m excited to empower learners with the tools and confidence they need to reach their goals.</p>
